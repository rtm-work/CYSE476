# CYSE476

This is a repository for my coding-based assignments for the CYSE476 class at George Mason University.

HW1 converts words into patterns based on the number of occurrances for each letter - aabbcc would be 112233, cat would be 123, and catt would be 1233, etc. It then scans through a list of words in a text file and returns all of the words that match that pattern.

HW2 Counts occurrances of letters in a text file and outputs a histogram.
